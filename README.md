# day jam madlibs

30 minute bus ride jam: mad libs using sublime text 2 snippets. not very interesting

Download this file and Sublime Text 2! Put this snippet file where your snippets usually go: if yr on a mac, you can probs run this command in the folder where you've downloaded the file:

```
cp day-jam-madlib.sublime-snippet ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/
```

Then open Sublime Text 2, create a new file, and type in "day-jam" then press tab. It'll automatically put your cursor in the first lil thing you need to fill in, so type in the first word, then press tab to get to the second word. Then press tab to get to the third. Then press tab to get to the fourth. YAAAAA
